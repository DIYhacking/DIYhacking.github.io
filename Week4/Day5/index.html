       <h1>Designing and printing a Hot Air Gun stand</h1>
        <p>This day I started off with designing a stand for the Hot Air gun. As I felt that without it the device keeps floating around the table. So I started off by making the design in Rhino.</p>
<p>First, I measured the dimensions for the gun using the vernier caliper and finalized the design for the stand. I wanted the hot end to be facing up as in case the power was not switched off, it wouldn&rsquo;t overheat any surfaces it is near to. Measuring:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next I drew a 2D outline of the stand in Rhino. I was able to do this based on the brief experience I had with it here. Furthermore, I made the curves into a surface and then extruded it to a height of 5mm. And it looked like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later, Francisco recommended on adding triangular support to the holders to make it more robust. I did this by drawing the outline for the structure, then turned it into a surface and then did a Boolean union to close the whole design into a closed poly surface. It looks like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After this, I exported the file in the .stl format and opened it in Cura. The preview of it looks like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then chose the advanced settings option and double checked for these parameters:</p>

        <h1>Virtual Box and Ubuntu</h1>
         <p>
           Setting up Virtual box for running Ubuntu from my Mac OS.
        </p>
        <p>Today we started off by installing virtual box for mac, this was done mainly to run Ubuntu from my mac system. This would make it easier to run fab modules and other programs that was made for Ubuntu.</p>

<p>I downloaded virtual box from here: <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">https://www.virtualbox.org/</a> and installed it by following the instructions from here: <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2012/03/27/install-run-ubuntu-linux-virtualbox/">http://osxdaily.com/2012/03/27/install-run-ubuntu-linux-virtualbox/</a></p>
<p>After this I was able to create a virtual system running on Ubuntu from my mac system.
